    <h1>Help</h1>

    <h2>I. Buttons</h2>

        <ol type="a">
            <li><b>Save:</b> Save settings into local storage.<br />&nbsp;</li>

            <li><b>Load:</b> Retrieve settings from local storage.<br />&nbsp;</li>

            <li><b>Exec:</b> Execute the current settings shown in the text area without saving.<br />&nbsp;</li>

            <li><b>Wipe:</b> Delete settings from local storage.  Once deleted, an opportunity will be given to
            restore the default settings.<br />&nbsp;</li>
        </ol>

    <h2>II. Editing</h2>

        <ol type="a">
            <li><b>Syntax:</b> Lookup Assistant requires specific formatting for each of its entries.
            This is done using standard JSON.<br />&nbsp;</li>

            <li><b>Overview:</b> Whitespace (spaces, tabs, and newlines) doesn't matter, and can be
            used to make things clearer and more readable.  Lookup Assistant has three types: link,
            menu, and separator.  A menu can contain any of the three types.  These must all be
            contained within a pair of brackets.  With the exception of a key's value, everything
            should be typed in lowercase.  Key-value pairs are explained below.
            <br /><br />
            High-level View of Menu Formatting:
<pre>
[
    link,
    separator,
    menu
        link,
        link
]
</pre>
            Format and details of each type are explained below.<br />&nbsp;</li>

            <li><b>Link:</b> This is the most common type.  A link tells Lookup Assistant
            where it should go and how it should get there.  It's written in this format:
<pre>
{
    "type": "link",
    "open": "tab",
    "title": "Google",
    "address": "http://www.google.com/search?q=%s"
}
</pre>
            The opening and closing brace are required.  Each item must be quoted, each key (the item
            to the left of the colon) and its value (the item to the right) must be separated by a
            colon, and a comma separates each key-value pair.  An explanation of each key follows.
            <br /><br />
            "type": This specifies the type.  It can be "link", "menu", or "separator".  You would,
            of course, use "link" for links.  However, this key is optional.  The default behavior
            is "link" if it's omitted.
            <br /><br />
            "open": This determines how Lookup Assistant behaves when one of its links is clicked.
            It can be one of three values: "tab", "window", or "incognito".  This key is optional.
            The default type is "tab" if it's omitted.
            <br /><br />
            "title": The name for this link.
            <br /><br />
            "address": The URL with a search token (%s).  The search token will ultimately be replaced
            by the highlighted text.  To find out where the search token goes in a URL, go to a website
            and perform a search to see what the URL looks like.  Copy the URL and replace the search
            term with the token.  Some sites have very long and complex search URLs and may require
            some effort.<br />&nbsp;</li>

            <li><b>Menu:</b> This type is used for grouping and organization.  A menu can contain any
            type, even itself.  It looks like this:
<pre>
{
    "type": "menu",
    "title": "Additional Links",
    "entry": []
}
</pre>
            Regarding braces, quotes, and commas, the same rules apply here as they did with the link
            type.  The "type" and "title" keys also work the same way as they did for links, except
            "type" is not optional here.
            <br /><br />
            The new key is "entry", and the value is a pair of brackets.  What's place between them
            will determine what appears in this menu.  Links, separators, and even additional menus
            are all valid.  See the link and separator section for proper formatting.<br />&nbsp;</li>

            <li><b>Separator:</b> The simplest type.  A separator only has a single key-value pair.
            Like menus, specifying the type is required.  It looks like this:
<pre>
{
    "type": "separator"
}
</pre>
            Separators will not appear if there is nothing to separate.<br />&nbsp;</li>
        </ol>

    <h2>III. Examples</h2>

        <ol type="a">
            <li><b>One Link:</b>
<pre>
[
    { "type": "link", "open": "tab", "title": "Google", "address": "http://www.google.com/search?q=%s" }
]
</pre></li>

            <li><b>Three Links + Separator:</b>
<pre>
[
    { "title": "Google", "address": "http://www.google.com/search?q=%s" },
    { "title": "Google Images", "address": "http://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&amp;q=%s" },
    { "type": "separator" },
    { "title": "Wikipedia", "address": "http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/%s" }
]
</pre>
            You can see in this example that commas not only separate pairs, but they separate the
            types as well.<br />&nbsp;</li>

            <li><b>Two Links + Separator + Menu with Two Links:</b>
<pre>
[
    { "title": "Google", "address": "http://www.google.com/search?q=%s" },
    { "title": "Google Images", "address": "http://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&amp;q=%s" },
    { "type": "separator" },
    { "type": "menu", "title": "Menu 1", "entry":
        [
            { "title": "Amazon", "address": "http://www.amazon.com/s/field-keywords=%s" },
            { "title": "eBay", "address": "http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=%s" }
        ]
    }
]
</pre></li>

            <li><b>One Link + Menu with a Menu, Each with One Link:</b>
<pre>
[
    { "type": "menu", "title": "Menu 1", "entry":
        [
            { "type": "menu", "title": "Menu 2", "entry":
                [
                    { "title": "Amazon", "address": "http://www.amazon.com/s/field-keywords=%s" }
                ]
            },
            { "title": "Wikipedia", "address": "http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/%s" }
        ]
    },
    { "title": "Google", "address": "http://www.google.com/search?q=%s" }
]
</pre>
            Having many nested menus can get quite confusing!<br />&nbsp;</li>
        </ol>

    <h2>IV. Errors</h2>

        <ol type="a">
            <li><b>SyntaxError:</b> This error means there's something wrong with the JSON formatting.
            Here are two common syntax errors and what they mean:
            <br /><br />
            <ul>
                <li>Unexpected end of input: The JSON formatting is incomplete.  This may be caused
                by a missing closing bracket.<br />&nbsp;</li>

                <li>Unexpected token X: X could be a bracket, a brace, or a comma.  Usually, this
                means there is something missing around X.  Check areas where edits were made.  Make
                sure all open brackets have a proper closing bracket, and check for correctness in
                braces and commas.<br />&nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
            Checklist:
            <ul>
                <li>The very first thing is an open bracket [.</li>
                <li>The very last thing is a closing bracket ].</li>
                <li>All keys and values are quoted.</li>
                <li>Each key and its value is separated by a colon.</li>
                <li>Each pair is separated by a comma.</li>
                <li>Types are also separated by a comma.</li>
                <li>No comma after the last key-value pair.</li>
                <li>No comma after the last type.</li>
                <li>Menu entry uses brackets [], not braces {} and not parentheses ().</li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            A good way to avoid these errors is to make small incremental changes and test them with
            the exec button.  Try not to make large changes all at once because it'll be hard to
            pinpoint the source of the error.<br />&nbsp;</li>

            <li><b>Missing Property:</b> This error means something was left out.  e.g. Failure to
            provide an address for the link type.<br />&nbsp;</li>

            <li><b>Unknown Type:</b> This error means something other than link, menu, or separator
            was specified as the type.  Spelling errors will cause this error, as will improper
            casing.  i.e. link is not the same as Link.<br />&nbsp;</li>
        </ol>
